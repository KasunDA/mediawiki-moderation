TODO:

Medium-prio:
* (testsuite) Provide ~100% automated test coverage of all functionality.

Low-prio:
* (feature) Intercept renaming of pages.
* (feature) Provide flexible handling of zero edits, for example suppress if
	there is no edit comment, mark them with "is zero edit" flag viewable
	to the moderator, add an option (disabled by default) to suppress
	zero edits completely, etc.
* (interface) For non-automoderated users: show a message on their
	Special:Contributions ensuring them that their edits will
	appear there when they are approved.

Background-prio (may not be needed):
* (feature) Post factum elimination of duplicate anonymous edits (e.g. when one
	of those edits is preloaded by the user).
* (interface) Ask "Really approve all edits from <user>?" when
	clicking "Approve all" (NOT via JavaScript).
* (interface) For each folder, display the number of new entries there
	in the last day and week.
* (interface) After the actions like Approve return to the moderation page,
	displaying the message like "Approved N edits" in the page header.
* (feature) Support uploads via API.

Tests to implement:
- check presence of "Return to Special:Moderation" link on both success and error (checking one action is sufficient).

FIXME (hard to fix properly):
- when user removes the section header (== here ==) while editing this
	section, text of this section will be overwritten by the text taken
	from the next section. Detect cases like that.

TODO:

Medium-prio:
* (testsuite) Provide ~100% automated test coverage of all functionality.
* (testsuite) Fix Selenium testsuite to work with 1.29.
	MobileFrontend for MediaWiki 1.29 shows odd behavior when editing sections
	(even when Moderation is not installed), which breaks some tests.
	Reproduced by [specs/debugtests/mobilefrontend-mw1.29.js].

Low-prio:
* (feature) Intercept renaming of pages.
* (feature) Provide flexible handling of zero edits, for example suppress if
	there is no edit comment, mark them with "is zero edit" flag viewable
	to the moderator, add an option (disabled by default) to suppress
	zero edits completely, etc.
* (interface) For non-automoderated users: show a message on their
	Special:Contributions ensuring them that their edits will
	appear there when they are approved.
* (interface) Perform the actions like Approve via Ajax (without leaving Special:Moderation).

Background-prio (may not be needed):
* (interface) For each folder, display the number of new entries there
	in the last day and week.
* (feature) Support uploads via API.

FIXME:
* tags assigned by Extension:AbuseFilter are not applied after Approve.

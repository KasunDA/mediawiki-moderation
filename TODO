TODO:

Medium-prio:
* (testsuite) Provide ~100% automated test coverage of all functionality.

Low-prio:
* (feature) Intercept renaming of pages.
* (feature) Provide flexible handling of zero edits, for example suppress if
	there is no edit comment, mark them with "is zero edit" flag viewable
	to the moderator, add an option (disabled by default) to suppress
	zero edits completely, etc.

Background-prio (may not be needed):
* (feature) Post factum elimination of duplicate anonymous edits (e.g. when one
	of those edits is preloaded by the user).
* (refactoring) Replace getUserpageByModId() with something more logical.
* (interface) Ask "Really approve all edits from <user>?" when
	clicking "Approve all" (NOT via JavaScript).
* (interface) For each folder, display the number of new entries there
	in the last day and week.
* (interface) After the actions like Approve return to the moderation page,
	displaying the message like "Approved N edits" in the page header.
* (feature) Support uploads via API.

Tests to implement:
- check upload-related diff messages in modaction=show
- check non-error responses from actions like Approve
- merge test
- check that anonymous edits are still preloaded after creating an account
- check the formatting of moderation logs (so far only API output is checked)

FIXME:
- when user removes the section header (== here ==) while editing this
	section, text of this section will be overwritten by the text taken
	from the next section. Detect cases like that.

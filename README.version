1) Version has the following format: x.y.z, e.g. 1.0.35.
2) Version is updated after any change in the PHP code, SQL, CSS/JS or i18n.
3) Version is not updated after changes in testsuite and documentation.
4) When version changes, [extension.json] must be updated.

Note: if some feature is being developed in a different Git branch
(e.g. "some-feature1"), then you need to update version number only once -
when merging this branch into master (git merge --no-ff).
